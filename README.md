ðŸ§  Reinforcement Learning & Dopamine 
This repository contains two ðŸ““ Jupyter notebooks that replicate and explore key findings from two foundational papers on the role of dopamine in reinforcement learning:

ðŸ“˜ [1] Schultz, W., Dayan, P., & Montague, P. R. (1997). A neural substrate of prediction and reward. Science

ðŸ“• [2] Dabney, W., et al. (2020). A distributional code for value in dopamine-based reinforcement learning. Nature

The goal is to bridge ðŸ§¬ neuroscience and ðŸ¤– reinforcement learning theory by reproducing core results and offering intuitive insights.

ðŸŽ¯ Also included: a presentation ðŸ“Š summarizing both models and their biological relevance.

ðŸ“š Theoretical foundations are inspired by the excellent Neuromatch RL & dopamine tutorial.
